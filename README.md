# WordCamp Minneapolis REST API Workshop - Part II

## Plugins:

JWT Authentication for WP REST API - https://wordpress.org/plugins/jwt-authentication-for-wp-rest-api/ 

## Tools:

Postman: https://www.getpostman.com/apps

## Setup: Install Workshop Plugin w/ Test Data

- Create a new WordPress site in your local development environment.  For this demo, I'm calling mine **rest.dev**.
- Download https://github.com/shawnhooper/wcmsp-rest/raw/master/rest-workshop.zip and install it as a plugin on your test site. 
  This will give you a new Custom Post Type ("restaurant") with some test data populated in it upon activation.
